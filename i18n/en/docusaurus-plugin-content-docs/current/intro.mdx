APIs are structures that allow software to communicate seamlessly and quickly with each other.
APIs work compatibly with all programming languages. İleti Merkezi allows you to add SMS sending features to your own software, tailored to your needs, with **bulk SMS API**, **single SMS API**, or **OTP SMS API** functionalities.

With our stable, high-capacity SMS API, which you can integrate into your applications quickly and easily, you can send SMS from your own products. You can easily use it for services such as one-on-one messaging, alarm systems, notifications & activation.

We provide **[100 SMS credits for free](https://www.iletimerkezi.com/panel/auth/signup?ref=toplusmsapi.com)** to all customers who sign up for free on our platform, allowing them to test the system's performance and our detailed SMS sending reports.
