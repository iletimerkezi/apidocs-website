# XML Post API
If you want to receive the status of the SMS package you have sent in XML format using the POST method of the HTTP protocol, you can follow the guidelines below.

## Request URL

<RequestURL type="POST" url="https://api.iletimerkezi.com/v1/get-report" />


## Request Body (Body)

```xml
<request>
  <authentication>
    <key></key>
    <hash></hash>
  </authentication>
  <order>
    <id></id>
    <page></page>
    <rowCount></rowCount>
  </order>
</request>
```

### Definitions

The request to the server should be wrapped with the <Badge>request</Badge> tag. The definitions of its sub-tags are as follows:

#### authentication
These are the user credentials that need to be sent to authorize the requested operation. Its sub-tags are:

+ **key:** The API Key that you can create from the settings section after logging into your iletimerkezi.com panel should be written here. It is mandatory to send this when making the request.

+ **hash:** iletimerkezi.com panelinize giriş yaptıktan sonra ayarlar bölümünden oluşturabileceğiniz API Anahtar ve Gizli Anahtar kullanılarak oluşturulmuş hash bu alana yazılmalıdır. İstek yapılırken gönderilmesi zorunludur.

#### order
Contains information about the order whose report will be queried. Its sub-tags are:

+ **id:** A unique numerical value representing the order. When you make an SMS sending request via the API, it is the <Badge>id</Badge> value returned by the server. It is mandatory to send this when making the request.

+ **page:** Represents the report page. It is not mandatory to send this when making the request. The default value is 1.

+ **rowCount:** Specifies the number of messages on a report page. It is not mandatory to send this when making the request. The default value is 1000. The maximum value is 1000. If more than 1000 messages were sent in an order, a new request should be made by increasing the value in the <Badge>page</Badge> tag.
