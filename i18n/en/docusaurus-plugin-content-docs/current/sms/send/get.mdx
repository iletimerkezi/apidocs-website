# Get API
If you want to send SMS with the GET method of the HTTP protocol, you can follow the instructions below. In general, you can integrate the settings in the SMS integration panels of ready-made software or hardware/devices such as firewall into the Ileti Merkezi with the help of the documentation here.

## Address to request

<RequestURL type="GET" url="https://api.iletimerkezi.com/v1/send-sms/get/" />

## Request Parameters
```bash
https://api.iletimerkezi.com/v1/send-sms/get/?username=USER_NAME&password=PASSWORD&text=Lorem%20ipsum%20dolor%20sit%20amet&receipents=5301234569,5301234570&sender=APITEST
```

:::tip Hint
After you write your own values ​​in the request parameters, you can try the integration by typing the url address into the address field of your browser. If you get an error, you can see how the error can be resolved in the status and error codes section.

### Definitions

The descriptions of the parameters sent in the request are as follows:

+ **username:**
It is the user name used when logging into transmissionerkezi.com. It is usually the mobile phone number given at the registration stage. It is required to be sent when making a request.

+ **password:**
This is the password used when logging into transmissionerkezi.com. It is required to be sent when making a request.

+ **text:**
Contains the text of the SMS to be sent. It is required to be sent when making a request. The URL must be encoded.

:::tip Hint
If you are not integrating with a ready-made panel or if you are making a panel for sms integration into your own software, you should encode these values ​​as your message text in the "text" field may contain characters that may corrupt the url address.

Every software language has built-in functions that do this encoding.

```bash
&text=Example of unencoded message text

After #encode, the message text should appear as follows
&text=Unencoded%20%C5%9F%20message%20text%20%C3%B6rne%C4%9Fi
```
