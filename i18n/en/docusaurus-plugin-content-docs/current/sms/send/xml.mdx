# XML Post API
If you want to perform SMS sending using the POST method of the HTTP protocol in XML format, you can follow the guidelines below.

## Request URL

<RequestURL type="POST" url="https://api.iletimerkezi.com/v1/send-sms" />


## Request Body (Body)

```xml
<request>
  <authentication>
    <key></key>
    <hash></hash>
  </authentication>
  <order>
    <sender></sender>
    <sendDateTime></sendDateTime>
    <iys>1</iys>
    <iysList>BIREYSEL</iysList>
    <message>
      <text><![CDATA[...]]></text>

        <number></number>
        <number></number>
      </receipents>
    </message>
  </order>
</request>
```

### Definitions

The request to be made to the server must be wrapped in a <Badge>request</Badge> tag. The definitions of the sub-tags of this tag are as follows:

#### authentication
These are the user information that must be sent to obtain authorization for the requested operation. The sub-tags are as follows:

+ **key:** After logging into your iletimerkezi.com panel, the API Key you can create from the settings section should be written in this field. It is mandatory to send it when making the request.

+ **hash:** After logging into your iletimerkezi.com panel, the hash created using the API Key and Secret Key that you can generate from the settings section should be written in this field. It is mandatory to send it when making the request.

#### order
The SMS messages to be sent are considered as an order and will start to be reported in this manner after the request is made. An order can sometimes include a single recipient and a single message text, but it can also contain multiple recipients and multiple message texts. The <Badge>order</Badge> tag is not a repeatable tag. Only one order can be sent per request. The sub-tags are as follows:

+ **sender:** This is the header information defined and approved by iletimerkezi.com, consisting of a maximum of 11 characters. The sent message is delivered to the recipient with the header specified by this parameter. It is mandatory to send it when making the request.

+ **sendDateTime:** This indicates the date of message sending. It is used for sending messages scheduled for a future date. The format is DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM. It is not mandatory to send it when making the request. The default value is the time at which the request is made.

+ **iys:** This indicates whether the message will be queried through the Message Management System (İYS). If you send this value as 1 (true), your messages will be queried through İYS; if you send it as 0 (false), they will not be queried. It is mandatory to send it when making the request.

  :::tip İpucu
  If you are sending commercial messages, this value must legally be 1. **Otherwise, penalties may apply.**

  [For detailed information about İYS, please click here.](https://www.iletimerkezi.com/blog/duyurular/iys-ileti-yonetim-sistemi-nedir)
  :::

+ **iysList:** This indicates the list you want to query through the Message Management System (İYS). If you have sent the iys value as 1, meaning you want your message to be queried through İYS, it is mandatory to send the iysList value as BIREYSEL (INDIVIDUAL) or TACIR (TRADER). If you send the iys value as 0, this field will be ignored.

  #### message
  This contains the information of the message to be sent. If you want to send different messages within a single order, the <Badge>message</Badge> tag must be repeated for the number of different messages you wish to send. The sub-tags are as follows:

  + **text:** This contains the SMS text to be sent. It is mandatory to send it when making the request.

  :::tip İpucu
  Since your message text may contain characters that could disrupt the structure of XML, we recommend writing your message text within `<![CDATA[...]]>`. The use of `<![CDATA[...]]>` is important for the proper delivery of your messages, as it may include expressions determined by users using your software.
  :::

  + **receipents:** This contains the recipients of the SMS messages to be sent. The recipients are specified by the following tag:

    + **number:** This contains the mobile phone number of the recipient. Formats such as 905xxxxxxxxx, +90 5xx xxx xx xx, and 5xxxxxxxxx can be used. It is mandatory to send it when making the request. If multiple recipients are to be defined for the specified message text, this tag must be repeated for the number of recipients.

## Server Response

```xml
<response>
  <status>
    <code></code>
    <message></message>
  </status>
  <order>
    <id></id>
  </order>
</response>
```

### Definitions

The response from the server is always wrapped in a <Badge>response</Badge> tag. The definitions of the sub-tags of this tag are as follows:

#### status
This contains information about the status of the operation. The values returned by this tag can also be obtained by checking the headers of the HTTP response. This tag is returned by default in every request. The sub-tags are as follows:

+ **code:** This is a numeric value indicating the status of the operation.
+ **message:** This contains an informational message about the status of the operation.

#### order
If the operation is completed successfully, it contains the information about the created order. If the operation fails, this tag is not returned. The <Badge>order</Badge> tag is not a repeatable tag. Only one order can be sent per request. The sub-tag is as follows:

+ **id:** This is a unique numeric value that represents the order. You can check the status of your order using this id value. If your order is scheduled to be sent at a later date, you can cancel your order using the id value.

## Hata Kodları
If the result of the request is negative, the error codes and messages that will be returned to you by the server are as follows:

      <th>Description</th>
