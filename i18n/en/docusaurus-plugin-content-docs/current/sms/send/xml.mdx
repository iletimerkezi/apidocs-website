<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="username" label="Username">

      <li>
        <strong>username:</strong> is the user name used when logging into transmissionerkezi.com. The mobile phone number you used while registering. It is required to be sent when making a request.

      </li>
    </ul>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### order
The SMSs to be sent are considered as an order and will be reported in this way after the request is made. The order can sometimes contain a single recipient and a single message text, or it can contain multiple recipients and more than one message text. The <Badge>order</Badge> tag is not a repeatable tag. Only one order can be submitted per request. The alt tags are as follows:

+ **sender:** This is the header information, consisting of maximum 11 characters, defined from the transmissionerkezi.com administration panel and approved by transmissionerkezi.com. The sent message is sent to the receiver with the header specified with this parameter. It is required to be sent when making a request.

+ **sendDateTime:** Indicates the sending date of the message. It is used for forward-dated message sending. Its format is DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM. It is not required to be sent when making a request. Its default value is the time the request is made.

+ **iys:** Indicates whether the message will be queried over the Message Management System (İYS). If you send this value as 1 (true), your messages will be queried via IYS, if you send it as 0 (false), it will not be queried. It is required to be sent when making a request.

  :::tip Hint
  This value should legally be 1 if you are sending a commercial message. **Otherwise, penalties may apply**.

  :::

+ **iysList:** Indicates the list you want to be queried via the Message Management System (İYS).
If you have sent the iys value as 1, that is, if you want your message to be queried via IYS, it is mandatory to send the iysList value as INDIVIDUAL or TRADEMARK.
If you are sending the iys value as 0, this field will be ignored.

  #### messages
It contains the message information to be sent. If different messages are to be sent in a single order, the <Badge>message</Badge> tag should be repeated as many times as the number of different messages to be sent. The alt tags are as follows

  + **text:** Contains the text of the SMS to be sent. It is required to be sent when making a request.

  :::tip Hint
  Structure of XML in your message textWe recommend that you write your message text in `<![CDATA[...]]>` as it may contain characters that break the code. The use of `<![CDATA[...]]>` is important for the healthy transmission of your messages, as there may be expressions determined by your users using your software in your message text.
  :::

  + **receipents:** Contains the recipients of the SMS to be sent. Recipients are indicated by the following label:

    + **number:** Contains the recipient's mobile phone number. Formats such as 905xxxxxxxxx, +90 5xx xxx xx xx, 5xxxxxxxxx can be used. It is required to be sent when making a request. If more than one recipient is to be defined for the specified message text, this label should be repeated as many as the number of recipients.
